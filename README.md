# CAS in Applied Data Science

Welcome to the main directory of the Certificate of Advanced Studies (CAS) in Applied Data Science repository.
This is a public GitHub repository which I created for the CAS in Applied Data Science final project.
While the basic project setup consists of Juptyter-Notebooks I decided to convert them to .py notebook files, with the python package `jupytext`.


## Overview

This repository is organized into modules, with each module containing specific course materials, resources, and assignments.

###  Contents

- **Notebooks:** Jupyter notebooks used in lectures, workshops, or assignments.
- **Datasets:** Store datasets used for analysis and practice exercises.
- **Documentation:** Additional documents, references, or supplementary materials.
- **Resources:** Other relevant resources that complement the learning experience.
