# CAS ADS Project

This is a public GitHub repository which I created for the CAS in Applied Data Science final project.
While the basic project setup consists of Juptyter-Notebooks I decided to convert them to .py notebook files, with the python package `jupytext`.

## Good to know
* Any content in the directory `data` apart from the `README.md` is ignored and won't be commited and pushed to the repository
