# notebook-template

This is a sample project which can be used to create Jupyter-Notebooks that are syncable with GitHub.
For Juptyter to work with .py notebook files, the python package `jupytext` must be installed.

## Good to know
* Any content in the directory `data` apart from the `README.md` is ignored and won't be commited and pushed to the repository
* If you work with sensitive data (usage data) place them in the directory `data` to avoid pushing them to GitHub
